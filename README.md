My first repository 

I created my GitHub repository on github.com and after it was created, I went to my GitHub desktop application and selected clone a repository. Then I signed in and it pulled my online repository.

Then, push your changes to Github and submit the repository URL to your instructor, including the name of the homepage file (usually index.html).
